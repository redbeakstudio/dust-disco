## Quarter Moon Nights
Multisensory art club nights.

## Orris
The Quarter Moon Night theme for Virgo season 2020 is **Orris**.

Orris root comes from the Iris.

"Orris is fine and full of violet-blue waves. It feels like a soft powder and has a light tickling which can swerve into fresh baby-spit up. Lightly sour. It has a wooden moment set in a wet cedar chest.
Green and some bitter leather."
Orris root at 10% on a paper strip, August 28, 2020, described by Chach.

Extracted from aged iris roots.

The Iris flower is connected with Iris, the Goddess of Rainbows.
A vulnerable goddess, Iris lives at the edge of clouds, and knows of storms ahead.

Lasts overnight: purple sour milk scent is stronger. 

## Dust Disco
Kicking off Pluto's return (the revolution) it's time burn the Man.
And we need to dance together again.

Conveniently this month, it's time for Burning Man & this time it's virtual.
No expense to set up a camp, no real dust, and we can attend from home. The theme is "the Multiverse."

We decided to create a virtual camp, and to also extend our invitation to scent friends attending Scent Week as well as animators and illustrators attending Lightbox.

## Premise
We are building a dust-scented disco set in an illustrated desert landscape. We hope to have some dancying fairy shrimp, stink bugs and other creatures. It's probably going to crash, we are learning. Learning is the point.

Our camp is casual and meant to be fun, playful, and focus on scent.
We will invite friends new & old to join us.

## Challenges
There are a mix of challenges we are working on with creative multi-sensory immersive tech.

* Organize a dusty-scent scavenger hunt.
* We are going to try to pipe a p5xr script hosted on Dropbox through an Aframe/ThreeJS bridge to render some processing art as a light show in an adapted instance of Mozilla Hubs in a 'composed scene.'
* We are exporting Grease Pencil illustrations straight to social VR & starting a Blender plugin for that purpose. Keep working on this.
* Figuring out the best way to have a DJ stream music for a social VR experience for WebXR.
* Create a p5js dust-storm for the party.
* Create plant illustrations for the environment.
* Make a costume box from GLB files hosted in Dropbox & loaded via a registry file.
