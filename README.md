## Orris
The Quarter Moon Night scent theme for Virgo season 2020 is **Orris**.

Orris root comes from the Iris.

### Organoleptic notes (how it smells)
"Orris is fine and full of violet-blue waves. It feels like a soft powder and has a light tickling which can swerve into fresh baby-spit up. Lightly sour. It has a wooden moment set in a wet cedar chest.
Green and some bitter leather."

"Lasts overnight: purple sour milk scent is stronger." - August 29, 2020, Chach.

The Iris flower is connected with Iris, the Goddess of Rainbows.
A vulnerable goddess, Iris lives at the edge of clouds, and knows of storms ahead.

## Dust Disco
Kicking off Pluto's return (the revolution) it's time burn the Man.
And we need to dance together again.

Conveniently, it's time for Burning Man & this time it's virtual.
No expense to set up a camp, no real dust, and we can attend from home. The theme is "the Multiverse."

It's a technical challenge (& expense in that regard), but is also a technical challenge that can be performed over the regular Web & made accessible for future projects, so we decided to go for it & learn more about social WebXR.

So, we decided to create a virtual camp. We will also extend our invitation to scent friends attending Scent Week as well as animators and illustrators attending Lightbox.

## Premise
We are building a dust-scented disco set in an illustrated desert landscape. We hope to have some dancying fairy shrimp, stink bugs and other creatures. It's probably going to crash, we are learning. Learning is the point.

Our camp is casual and meant to be fun, playful, and focus on scent.
We will invite friends new & old to join us.

## Challenges
There are a mix of challenges we are working on with creative multi-sensory immersive tech.

* Organize a dusty-scent scavenger hunt.
* We are going to try to pipe a p5xr script hosted on Dropbox through an Aframe/ThreeJS bridge to render some processing art as a light show in a social VR scene in Storybox. (Scrapped the idea of using Hubs because the cloud service is several servers & most of what we needed is found in networked-aframe component.)
* We are exporting Grease Pencil illustrations straight to social VR & starting a Blender plugin for that purpose. Keep working on this.
* Figuring out the best way to have a DJ stream music for a social VR experience for WebXR.
* Create a p5js dust-storm for the party.
* Create plant illustrations for the environment.
* Make a costume box from GLB files hosted in Dropbox & loaded via a registry file.
